This is the Refnotes Dokuwiki plugin.

This repository is a fork from the initial repository, with the following
enhancement (which make it work on my system):
 * changed strange parsing of .idx file to get the pages in a namespace,
     use builtin Dokuwiki function "search" instead.
 * adding .gitignore, README and LICENSE
